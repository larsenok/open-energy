# Human Energy Exchange

An immersive, static world map that visualises electricity generation and demand across major grids. Regions breathe and glow to show grid strain while live open-data overlays provide extra context for wind, solar and air quality.

## Highlights

- **Accurate global canvas** – the map now uses a Mercator projection with a refined world outline, so regional pulses appear where you'd expect them.
- **Expanded grid coverage** – deterministic data generation now spans nine high-impact regions across every continent.
- **Live open data overlays** – additional insight cards stream readings from Open-Meteo, OpenAQ, and the Emissions API whenever a region is selected.
- **Zero-build tooling** – everything ships as vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS generated by a tiny Node build script.

## Getting started

1. Install Node.js 18 or newer.
2. Install dependencies (installs only dev tooling metadata):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Generate the static site and dataset:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Preview the build locally:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

   Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Project layout

- `public/` – static assets, including the HTML entry point and client-side script.
- `src/data/energy.js` – deterministic data generator that seeds the experience with grid balances.
- `build.js` – copies static assets into `dist/` and emits `dist/data/energy.json`.
- `serve.js` – lightweight static server for local previews.
